# Examples

This directory contains examples of the combined single Go source file generated
by Gottani and its original source files in each example directory.

In each directory, the `combined.go` is the combined single Go sourcefile and
the `src/` directory has the original source files.  Some example has a third
party libraries in `lib/` directory.

The following command generates the combined.go in each directory.

```shell
# gottani src > combined.go
```
